CI_Facebook is a Facebook Library for CodeIgniter.

Simply copy/merge all the files into the corresponding locations and setup config/facebook.php.

There are unit tests written for each function/class.  You will need PHPUnit to execute them.

Accessing the Facebook object is easy since the hook is auto-loading it.

e.g. $user_data = $this->facebook->fb->api_client->fql_query("select name from user where uid = TARGETUSERID");

Please note : this is old facebook api if you have any qureies see facebook documentation.
